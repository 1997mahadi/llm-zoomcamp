# Course: Implementing a RAG Pipeline with LLM and OpenAI

## Overview

In this course, you will learn how to implement a RAG (Retriever-Answerer-Generator) pipeline using LLM (Large Language Model). The pipeline integrates retrieval and generation techniques to answer questions based on FAQ documents from Zoomcamp courses.

## Course Outline

### 1. Introduction to LLM and RAG

Introduction to Large Language Models (LLM) and the RAG (Retriever-Answerer-Generator) pipeline. Understand the concepts of retrieval, answering, and generation in natural language processing.

### 2. Preparing the Environment

Set up the development environment for implementing the RAG pipeline. Install necessary libraries and tools, configure API keys for accessing external services like OpenAI's Ollama.

### 3. Retrieval

Implement retrieval mechanisms to fetch relevant FAQ documents from Zoomcamp courses. Explore techniques for efficient document retrieval using Elasticsearch.

### 4. Generation with OpenAI

Utilize OpenAI's capabilities for generating natural language responses based on retrieved documents. Learn how to formulate prompts and process responses using OpenAI's models.

#### 4.1 OpenAI API Alternatives: Ollama

Explore alternative APIs such as OpenAI's Ollama for generating responses and compare their functionalities and capabilities.

### 5. Cleaned RAG Flow

Optimize and refine the RAG pipeline for enhanced performance and accuracy. Implement best practices for data cleaning, preprocessing, and workflow management.

### 6. Searching with Elasticsearch

Enhance search capabilities within the RAG pipeline using Elasticsearch. Implement advanced querying techniques to retrieve specific information from indexed FAQ documents.
